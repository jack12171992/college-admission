# college-admission

Instruction to use the application:

1.) Clone down the repo by using git clone


2.) Build the artifact by running "mvn clean install" or the artifact is already included in this repo, which is the college-admisssion.jar file


3.) Navigate to the target folder and run "java -jar college-admission.jar" to start up the application.


4.) Since this is to examine a list of college applicants with several information so I figured that putting all the information into
a Excel file would be a proper to handle this, so the input file should be an Excel file.


5.) An example record file is already included which located at src/test/resources/record.xlsx. After the application is up and running, it will
ask the user to provide a Excel file, which in this the user could type in "src/test/resources/record.xlsx"


6.) The result is written in the same excel file and now the user could see the result by opening up the same record file.
